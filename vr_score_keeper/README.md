*   `vr_tournaments/`: The main Django app containing the core logic for the application.
*   `settings/`: Django settings, separated into `base.py`, `dev.py`, and `prod.py`.
*   `templates/`: Base templates for the project.
*   `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml`: Files for setting up the development and production environments using Docker.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd vr_score_keeper
    ```

2.  **Build and run the Docker containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This will start the following services:
    *   `web`: The Django application running on `localhost:8000`.
    *   `db`: A PostgreSQL database instance.

3.  **Create a superuser account:**

    Open a new terminal and run the following command to create a superuser account, which will allow you to access the admin interface and protected views:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create your superuser.

4.  **Access the application:**

    You can now access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py test vr_tournaments
```

## Deployment

For production deployment, you can use the `docker-compose.prod.yml` file, which is optimized for a production environment.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
```

This will run the Django application with Gunicorn and serve static files using WhiteNoise.
